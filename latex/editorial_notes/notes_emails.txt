In general look for emails with subject title: "Repository for NATO STO Templates:

##########################

We often have chapter titles that consist of more than one line of text (sometimes up to 4 lines) because the standard is to never abbreviate titles – see attached examples.
 
The rules are that the top line is always the shortest, with each following lines a little longer, with the bottom line being the longest. The text on the bottom line should always finish at least 2 centimetres away from the existing NATO or STO logo and should sit just above the rule.
**** this is dealt with by setting the minipage width to 0.8\textwidth from the \fancyhead[RO] / \fancyhead[LE]

The font sizes are as follows:

·         1 to 2 lines of heading text = Arial Bold 11 pt

·         3 lines of heading text = Arial Bold 10 pt

·         4 lines of text = Arial Bold 8 or 9 pt (depending on the length of the chapter title)
 
In terms of heading numbering, I noticed in the sample PDF provided that the NOMENCLATURE heading was not numbered (and it should be) – if this was Chapter 8, then it should be numbered “8.0”. In addition, the ACKNOWLEDGMENTS heading should also be numbered.
 
With regards to the page number in the footer, the dash is bigger than the one used in the STO MS Word Template (see attached).
 
I also noticed that there was no paragraph spacing on pages 8-3 and 8-4 – there should be 12 pts of space between each paragraph. Also there should be NO indentation of 1st line of text in a paragraph. Examples of paragraphs, spacing and a caption can be seen in the PDF file attached.
 
With regards to URLs cited in text, these are always coloured NATO blue (Pantone # 128).
 
Finally, as I mentioned before, figure and table captions should be ‘Title’ Case and not ‘Sentence’ Case.

Dear Kelly,

Good to know that there is no need to use abbreviated titles for the headers. Thanks!

Dear Dr. Scalo,
 
Title case is when the first letter of all major words is capitalised … for example: Figure 1-1: A Map of the Provinces in the Country of Canada. Sentence case is when only the first letter of the first word is capitalised (unless it is a proper noun) … for example: Figure 1-1: A map of the provinces in the country of Canada.
 
Best regards,
 
Kelly

Hi Carlo,

I could get rid of the 'too much white space at the bottom of the page' (see Kelly's comments) by removing the command '\enlargethispage{-2cm}' in nato-sto.cls, line 146.

Our chapter 8 is not affected by Kelly's general comment that the figure and table captions should be 'Arial Bold 9 pt'. So I didn't have to worry about this 'issue' in our AVT 240 version. However, now I remember again that using the 'subfig' package did have some unwanted/unexpected side effects last year when working on the Scitech 2018 version. Obviously, I had added a comment last autumn about this side effect when loading the subfig package needed for the input of one of my co-authors:

\usepackage[caption=false]{subfig}  % triggers bold figure caption with smaller font

Maybe some commands from this package can be used as a basis for implementing the requested change of fonts for the captions.

Regards,

Stefan
